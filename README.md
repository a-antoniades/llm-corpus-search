## Incidental Supervision

### Environment Setup

Once you pull the repo, I added a `requirements.txt` file, try to create your environment with that, although it may not work. In that case, please comment out the culprits from the file, and install the manually.

### Plotting Translation results

Use `plot_translation.py` and set your `LANG_DF_PTH`. The file was made to be readily compatible with jupyter notebook execution.
