Incidental Supervision

## How to use environment

I needed to change the huggingface libarary a little bit, to properly track training dynamics accross multiple datasets.

Please use this conda environment, you can just specify this path: `/share/edc/home/antonis/LLM-Incidental-Supervision/incidental-supervision/env/bin/python` (I gave you permissions to this file, feel free to copy it into your own directory)

## How to use data

The paths to the data are included inside the scripts and code.
I gave you permissions, so as long as you run those, everything should work, but let me know if that's not the case

## How to run the code

@Xinyi, the baseline model experiment is included in ```exp_1train_baselines.sh```
